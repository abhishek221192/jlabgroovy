#summary In this tutorial we present examples of working with the MTJ library in GroovyLab.

= Introduction =

`The MTJ library is a well designed Java high-level object oriented wrapper around some of the functionality of JLAPACK. In this tutorial we present some examples of using MTJ from GroovyLab with a user-friendly scripting interface. `


= `Working with the MTJ library in GroovyLab` =

`The MTJ library is integrated in the default libraries of GroovyLab, therefore any separate installation is unecessary.`

{{{

n = 5  // size of the matrix

A = new no.uib.cipr.matrix.LowerSymmDenseMatrix(n)
Ad = no.uib.cipr.matrix.Utilities.populate(A)
no.uib.cipr.matrix.Utilities.lowerSymmetrice(Ad)   // create a lower symmetric matrix
