#summary We describe how we can utilize effectively Java libraries from GroovyLab.

= Introduction =

`Although, GroovyLab has not currently extensive documentation, the user can still work effectively using the powerful Java libraries that GroovyLab exploits. The philosophy is:`

  * `Convert the ` _`GroovySci Matrix`_ `or the ` _`double[][]` `array type to the native representations of the preferrable Java library. 
  * `Thereafter, we perform the desired numerical analysis using the routines of the library, and finally
  * `Convert back any desired results to the familiar ` _`GroovySci Matrix`_ `or ` _`double[][]` `arrays
