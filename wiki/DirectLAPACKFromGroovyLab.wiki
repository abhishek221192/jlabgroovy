#summary In this tutorial we present examples of working with LAPACK/JLAPACK in GroovyLab.

= Introduction =

`LAPACK/JLAPACK are powerful linear algebra packages. However, their routines have a complex and difficult to use interface. GroovyLab offers a simplified interface to some of the most useful routines. We describe here some examples. 



= `Working with the MTJ library in GroovyLab` =

`The MTJ library is a well designed Java high-level object oriented wrapper around some of the functionality of JLAPACK. In this tutorial we present some examples of using MTJ from GroovyLab with a user-friendly scripting interface. `

`The MTJ library is integrated in the default libraries of GroovyLab, therefore any separate installation is unecessary.`

==  Creating a lower-symmetrical Dense Matrix ==

{{{

n = 5  // size of the matrix

A = new no.uib.cipr.matrix.LowerSymmDenseMatrix(n)
Ad = no.uib.cipr.matrix.Utilities.populate(A)
no.uib.cipr.matrix.Utilities.lowerSymmetrice(Ad)   // create a lower symmetric matrix
