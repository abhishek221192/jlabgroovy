#summary A tutorial on learning the basics of jLab

= Introduction =

`In this tutorial we demonstrate the more important parts of working with jLab. We concentrate on GroovySci mode which is much more powerful and promising than the j-Script mode.`

= The essentials of the User Interface =

`After initialization jLab presents two windows: ` *`a. The Programmer's editor window`* `that provides a `*`specialized editor`*`, along with the `*`output console`*, and *`b. The Main User Interface window`* `that provides things as the` *`command console window, the explorer, the history window, the main menu bar, and the toolbars`*. 

`The user can execute GroovySci scripts in two ways: `
  # `At the Command Console Window`
  # `With the jLab programmer's editor`
