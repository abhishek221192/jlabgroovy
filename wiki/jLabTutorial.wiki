#summary A tutorial on learning the basics of jLab

= Introduction =

`In this tutorial we demonstrate the more important parts of working with jLab. We concentrate on GroovySci mode which is much more powerful and promising than the j-Script mode.`

= The essentials of the User Interface =

`After initialization jLab presents two windows: ` *`a. The Programmer's editor window`* `that provides a `*`specialized editor`*`, along with the `*`output console`*, and *`b. The Main User Interface window`* `that provides things as the` *`command console window, the explorer, the history window, the main menu bar, and the toolbars`*. 

`The user can execute GroovySci scripts in two ways: `
  # `At the Command Console Window`
  # `With the jLab programmer's editor`

`The command console window is convenient for single line command execution, i.e. we can write: `
{{{
t= inc(0, 0.01, 50); x = sin(0.5*t)+2.3*cos(2.3*t); plot(t,x)
}}}
`and execute directly this command by pasting it at the command window.`

`Contrary the jLab programmer's editor allows to execute program text, while editing it. `

`To execute program text: ` *`select the text and press F6.`*

`For example let execute the code: `

{{{
sm=0.0
for (k in 0..2000)
 sm += k
println("sm = "+sm)
}}}
