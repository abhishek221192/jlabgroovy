#summary Tutorial on the Matrix class of jlabgroovy.

= Introduction =

`This tutorial describes by means of examples the Matrix class of jlabgroovy.`


= Tutorial on Matrix class =

`The Matrix class implements zero-indexed two-dimensional dense matrices in GroovySci. That matrices are mostly based on the JAMA library.`


== Constructors ==

`Matrix(rows: Integer, cols: Integer) // Creates a Matrix of size rows, cols initialized to zeros`

{{{
m=new Matrix(2, 3)
}}}

`Construction by specifying the initial elements, e.g.`

{{{
m = M([ [4.5, 5.6, -4], [ 4.5, 3, -3.4]]) 
}}}


`Construct a Matrix by copying the array values, Matrix(double [][] da ), Creates a Matrix initialized with the da array`
{{{
dd = new double[2][4]

dd[1][1]=11

mdd = new Matrix(dd)

}}}



`Construction with filling an initial value, Matrix(int N, int M, double value), e.g. `

{{{
m = new Matrix(6,8, 6.8)
}}}
