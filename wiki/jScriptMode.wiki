#summary jScript Mode of jLab: Matlab-like scripts executed with a Java interpreter.

= Introduction =

`The jScript mode of jLab is switched with the ` *`F2`* `key. Although, is not as powerful as the GroovySci mode, it provides an easy Matlab-like syntax. We present some examples of jScripts.`


= Example 1 =
{{{
fName  = "jExec.Functions.Chaotic.DoubleScrollDiffSys";
 n= 3;
 xStart = 0.0;
 xEnd =  getNumberDialog("Enter up integration value");
x0(1) = rand(1); 
x0(2) = rand(1); 
x0(3) = rand(1);

h0=0.000001;  tic; 

yOut = jdiffsys(xStart, xEnd, n, x0, fName, aeta, reta,  h0);
