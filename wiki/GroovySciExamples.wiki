#summary We provide some examples of working with GroovySci in jLab.

= Introduction =

`In this page we provide small examples of using GroovySci, the default jLab mode, in scientific applications. The code can be executed either:`

  *  `by pasting it at the jLab's command console (it must be in GroovySci mode, not in jScript, F2 switches these modes)`
  *  `by pasting the code within the jLab's programmer's editor, select the code and pressing F6`
